Now anything that uses Backbone.sync() internally should work with a cross domain request from IE7/8/9 where they didn't previously. This means model.fetch(), model.save(), model.sync, collection.fetch(), etc.\n\n### Bower\nEasy install with Bower.\n\n```\nbower install backbone.crossdomain\n```\n\n### RequireJS\n\nThis library has AMD support for use with RequireJS. This is not necessary to use this library but helpful when building an app with AMD.\n\nInclude [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org):\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lib/require.js\"></script>\n```\n\nRequireJS config (with Backbone and Underscore using a shim):\n```javascript\nrequire.config({\n    paths: {\n        jquery: \"lib/jquery\",\n        underscore: \"lib/underscore\",\n        backbone: \"lib/backbone\",\n        crossdomain: \"lib/Backbone.CrossDomain\"\n    },\n    shim: {\n        underscore: {\n            exports: '_'\n        },\n        backbone: {\n            deps: ['underscore', 'jquery'],\n            exports: 'Backbone'\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nRequire crossdomain:\n```javascript\nrequire([\"underscore\", \"backbone\", \"crossdomain\"], function(_, Backbone) {\n    // Define your models and collections as normal\n});\n```\n\nUse Backbone as you would normally, this is a drop-in replacement and shouldn't require anything to change.\n\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under MIT license\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Victor Quinn\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
